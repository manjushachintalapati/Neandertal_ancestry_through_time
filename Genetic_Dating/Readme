Genetic Dating analysis in the publication- Neandertal ancestry through time
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Step1: Convert the Admixfrog files into eigen files 
	Convert the snp file from Admixfrog to eigen ind, geno and snp files using a genetic Map
        example eigen files for one sample are the folder eigendata

Step2: Run the dating analysis using Neandertal dating took - moorjani et al.,2016
	We use the method in moorjani et al., 2016 (Nenadertal Dating -https://github.com/priyamoorjani/Neanderthal_dating) to estimate the time of Neandertal mixture. The example par file is given in the folder and script to post the job. 

Step3: Error correct the genetic maps using get_posteriror tool from Sriram Sankararaman (Cite)
       After we perform the dating, we corrected for errors in genetic map using the method get_posterior (https://github.com/sriramlab/dating). The example par file is in the folder.  

Step4: Convert the output into years BP
	Convert the time from get_posterior into years before present (BP) using 28 years as generation time.
